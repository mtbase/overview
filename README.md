# MTBase Project Overview

MTBase is a project at Systems Group, Department of Computer Science, ETH Zurich. It enables cross-tenant query processing on regular DBMS systems with a language called MTSQL. MTSQL extends SQL with addititional syntax and semantics for multi-tenant datbases. Please find out more about MTSQL and MTBase by reading our [white paper](extended.pdf).

## About MT-H
The MT-H benchmark is a modified version of the TPC benchmark H (TPC - H), to measure the performance of Multi-Tenant Query Processing in Relational Database Management Systems. 
It is defined to work with Multi-Tenancy DBMS system, and to allow semantically correct cross-tenant queries.
